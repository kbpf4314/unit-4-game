For this assignment I did almost all of my code in javascript.

You'll notice that most of my html is in js, and has been pushed to the DOM.

I found this way to actually be challenging for me, and found it difficult to style my page after getting the game to function.

I'm sure with more practice, and more time I could get this page to look, and work better. I may also just write my js and html separate for future applications until I can get a better grasp on it.

Thank you.
